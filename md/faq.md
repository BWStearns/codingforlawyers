# Frequently Asked Questions

## What? Lawyers and Coding?

It's true. Lawyers *can* code. In fact, if you're a lawyer, the truth is that it's easier than you think. I am a lawyer, and a coder.[^1] And, in the course of two years, I have gone from knowing essentially nothing to being a decent coder, in several languages. This book is intended to shorten that time dramatically for others, who like me decide that they want to learn to code.

## Why this book?

One thing that I discovered, when learning to code, is that there are surprisingly few freely available books on the *basics* of coding, books that assume you know *nothing* about coding, books that assume you went to law school because you didn't like numbers.[^2]

## What can I do to help?

At the moment, I am still making many decisions about this project, and I want your feedback. Is it worth it? Are any lawyers actually interested? Are the chapters too dense? Too easy? Are there topics that you definitely want covered? A great way to help would be to send me an email at dave@esq.io and let me know what you think. An even better way is to submit an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request.

## When will you finish?

This is obviously still a work-in-progress. I expect that it will take me a few months to get it into `1.0` shape. Obviously, if there's a large demand, I'll prioritize it accordingly. So, please send feedback.

## No banner ads? No fee?

No. Inspired by [Matthew Butterick's Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com), it is my plan to offer this as a free ebook. But, if you feel compelled to contribute, I have set up a [Dwolla Hub](https://www.dwolla.com/hub/esqio). No amount over $50 will be accepted and, due to ethical restrictions associated with my day job, if you happen to do business with the District of Columbia government, do not make any contributions.

[^2] Full disclosure: I have a degree in mechanical engineering. I love numbers but most of my peers don't.
